# Trained models

The pre-trained models (generator networks of the end-to-end deep image reconstruction model) can be downloaded from: <https://figshare.com/articles/End-to-end_deep_image_reconstruction_from_human_brain_activity/7916144>.

These models were trained to reconstruct the stimulus images from human brain fMRI activity, which were trained for 500,000 mini-batch iterations, with batch size of 64.

The pre-trained models of 3 human subjects are released:

- trainedmodel_sub-01
- trainedmodel_sub-02
- trainedmodel_sub-03

In the directory of each subject, there are 2 files:

- **generator.caffemodel**: the Caffe caffemodel file for the trained generator
- **generator_test.prototxt**: the Caffe prototxt file for the generator
- **discriminator.caffemodel**: the Caffe caffemodel file for the trained discriminator
- **discriminator.prototxt**: the Caffe prototxt file for the discriminator
